# Realtime-chat-app

A chat app which can be used to chat with any number of persons in real time .

## Link of the app which I have hosted on cloud .

App hosted on netlify : [https://6085310291ced4408c44d3ea--animesh-chatapp-frontend.netlify.app/](https://6085310291ced4408c44d3ea--animesh-chatapp-frontend.netlify.app/)

Server build using express ,node , socket.io and many other libraries is hosted live on heroku .

## How to use the Chat App

once you create the room in the app you just need to share the link to all your friends and  ask them to just enter their name in the url itself in front of the "?name=" query parameter in the url .
After that they will be able to join the chat .

Please note that two users in the same room can't have the same name .So while entering your name in the url "?name=" query parameter you have to make sure everyone types in different names .

### Thank you.
